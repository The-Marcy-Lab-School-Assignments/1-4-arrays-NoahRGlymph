What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
Both the spread operator and the rest parameter use the ... syntax, they serve different purposes: the spread operator is used for expanding elements, making copies, and concatenating arrays or objects, while the rest parameter is used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array within a function's parameter list.
